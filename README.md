# OSDM

The aims of the **Open Sales and Distribution Model (OSDM)** are twofold:

- to substantially **simplify the booking process for customers** of rail trips and,
- to **lower complexity and distribution costs** for distributors and railway carriers.

OSDM strengthens rail as a convenient and ecological means of transportation by simplifying distribution. 
Finally, it lays a solid fundament which can be extended to the distribution of other means of transportation.

The OSDM Online API and specification essentially consists of two parts: **Offline Model** and **Online API**.
The Online API works in two modes: **Distributor Mode** and **Allocator Mode**. The Allocator Mode differs 
from the Distributor Mode only in that additionally to **Admissions (aka. tickets)**, **Reservations**, 
**Integrated reservations**, or **ancillaries** also **priced segments (aka. fares)** are offered and can be booked.

The OSDM Model and documents are Open Source and freely available to all parties interested. 
The OSDM-Online API is modelled in `YAML`, fully supporting the `REST paradigm`.
