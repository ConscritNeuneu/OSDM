We are proud to release **Version 3.0** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties (Retailers, Distributors,
Railways, Bus Undertakings). Focus is to support the Swedish Market which
revamps its distribution and pricing landscape based on OSDM.

See the [Release Notes 3.0](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v3.0/)
for more details.

Additionally, the [OSDM sandbox](https://osdm.io/tools/sandbox/) by
[Sqills](https://www.sqills.com/) has been revised and is now based on their
_productive system_.

For the first time we are also releasing the
[OSDM UML model](https://osdm.io/tools/uml-model) from which the YAML
specification is being generated.

Furthermore we have started work on a joint test and validation set. This should
help the adoption of OSDM as well as guarantee that the implementations are
interoperable.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
