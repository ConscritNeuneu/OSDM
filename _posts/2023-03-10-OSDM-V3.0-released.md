We're proud to release **Version 3.0** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). In scope of this increment are
various improvements proposed by the different parties (Retailers, Distributors,
Railways, Bus Undertakings).

See the [Release Notes 3.0](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v3.0/)
for more details.

Additionally, the [OSDM sandbox](https://osdm.io/tools/sandbox/) by
[Sqills](https://www.sqills.com/) has been revised and is now based on their
_productive system_.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
