We are proud to release **Version 3.0.2** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/). This is a maintenance release which
also adds some features requested by the Swedish market in non-breaking way
adhering to semantic versioning.

See the
[Change Log](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/blob/master/specification/v3.0/ChangeLog.md)
for more details.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
