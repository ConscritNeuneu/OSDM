The OSDM Steering group just released the Version 1.2 of the [OSDM Specification](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/spec/)
under the [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) Open Source Licence.

In scope of this increment were various improvements proposed by railways as well as distributors:

- I-16 Add support to sell non-journey based products (passes) (DB/öBB/SBB)
- I-28 Add support to query availabilities (Sqills/SBB/ÖBB/DB)
- I-3 Complete support for partial refund/exchange (Trenitalia/SNCF/Amadeus/BeNe)
- I-4 Align /locations and /trips to transmodel (OJP) (SBB)
- I-18 Combinations of offers onto one fulfillment (SBB/Amadeus)
- I-7 Add full support for PRMs (UIC/CIT)

See the [Release Notes 1.2]() for more details.

Additionally, we have started to turn the specification into running come:

- **OSDM Sandbox:** The aim of the OSDM sandbox is to provide implementing or interesting parties access to a working
  prototype to study the behavior and semantics of the OSDM API. The sandbox is kindly provided by Sqills
  and is open to any party interested in implementing OSDM.
  See [OSDM Sandbox](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/sandbox/) for details.

- **Hermes/Hosa to OSDM (H2O) converter**: The aim of this online converter build by Hitrail is to build a migration path from the
  Hermes/Hosa protocol to OSDM. Thus if a railway does not support OSDM yet the Hermes Hosa to OSDM (H2O) Converter
  ensures that it can connect to railways supporting OSDM. Conversely, if a railway only supports OSDM it guarantees
  that it can connect to railways supporting Hermes Hosa only.
  See [OSDM H2O Converter](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/conversionHHtoOSDM/) for details.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/team/) for its hard work.
