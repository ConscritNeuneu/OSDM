OSDM has moved to the [osdm.io](https://osdm.io) domain. This step further stresses the openness of the API specification to all parties interested as well as its applicability to all modes of transportation.

Thanks to [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch) for providing the domain name and [UIC](https://uic.org) to providing the github pages.
