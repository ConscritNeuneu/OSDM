[Sqills](https://sqills.com) S3 Passenger is the first inventory management
system to implement the online part of the OSDM managed by UIC and the
FSM-Initiative.

Sqills’ inventory management, sales and distribution
SaaS platform S3 Passenger, is the first IT platform with a working OSDM-online
implementation based on the recently completed specification designed by
railway carriers and ticket distributors.  After joining the initiative late
2020, Sqills has committed to contributing to the technical standard to promote
interoperability. This effort has now resulted in the first actually working
implementation which can soon be made available in production for operators
running S3 Passenger.

Vittorio Carta, Vice-Chair of OSDM, said:

*“For OSDM, 2020 was the year of specifying the standard, and we now prove that
2021 can be the year of its implementation. We are excited and also proud about
the example that Sqills has set for contributing carriers of how quick and
relatively easy the OSDM-online standard could be implemented, and look forward
to see partners follow soon. It proves that for a capable back-end system, the
OSDM-online interface covers all relevant principles well. The ticket
distributors in the OSDM workgroup can now prepare to actually integrate the
API based on this first implementation. A big step forwards in the Year of
“Rail” and not only, as OSDM has been designed to accomplish multi-modal
mobility solutions.”*

Johan Nieuwerth, Sqills Founder & S3 Product Owner, said:

*“Supporting cross-operator cooperation to improve passenger comfort and
compete with car and air travel is a key priority. We have embraced OSDM as a
contributing factor to this goal, as the standard reflects the S3 Passenger
capabilities well and essentially unifies the distributor-to-carrier dialogue,
aligned with S3’s native multi-inventory features. Now that inventory managed
in S3 can be distributed via OSDM, the next focus is the opposite flow: making
OSDM capable Non-S3 carriers available within S3 Passenger for operators in our
community that wish to connect bilaterally with other inventories as well.
Sqills will make a so-called powered by S3 Passenger available to the OSDM
community partners, so that this first step will hopefully actually help
increase the speed of adoption of the standard.”*
