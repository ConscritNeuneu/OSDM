The OSDM Steering group just released the Version 1.3 of the [OSDM Specification](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/spec/)
as well as access to the [OSDM Sandbox](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/sandbox/) to all interested parties.

In scope of this increment were various improvements proposed by railways as well as distributors:

- I-4 Align /locations and /trips to Transmodel
- I-8 Add real time support
- I-29 Add support for promotions
- I-27 Add support for group reservations
- I-30 Add the possibility for direct booking
- I-40 Indicate test data in offline data exchange

Additionally we technically improved the API by adding the following tools:

- I-31 Add idempotency to POST and PATCH operations
- I-38 Standardize Scrolling Syntax
- I-19 Add support for distributed tracing

See the [Release Notes 1.3](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v1.3/) for more details.

Additionally, we have started to turn the specification into running code:

- **OSDM Sandbox:** The sandbox is kindly provided by Sqills
  and is open to any party interested in implementing OSDM.
  See [OSDM Sandbox](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/sandbox/) for details.

- **OSDM Demo App** Directly connecting to the sandbox is the demo app which covers the complete journey
  planning and booking flow. The app is open to any party interested in implementing OSDM.
  See [OSDM Demo App](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/demo-app/) for details.

- **Hermes/Hosa to OSDM (H2O) converter**: The aim of this online converter build by Hitrail is to build
  a migration path from the Hermes/Hosa protocol to OSDM. Thus if a railway does not support OSDM yet the
  Hermes/Hosa to OSDM (H2O) Converter ensures that it can connect to railways supporting OSDM. Conversely,
  if a railway only supports OSDM it guarantees that it can connect to railways supporting Hermes/Hosa only.
  See [OSDM H2O Converter](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/H2O-converter/) for 
  details.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/team/) for its hard work.
