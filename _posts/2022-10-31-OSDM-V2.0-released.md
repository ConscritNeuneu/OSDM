We're proud to release **Version 2.0** of the
[OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/).

In scope of this increment were various improvements proposed by railways as
well as distributors. The following features have been added with version 2.0 of
OSDM.

- Terminology aligned with TAP-TSI
- Unified resource for trip based offers and non-trip based offers
- Separate resource to retrieve availabilities for seats, couchettes,â€¦
- Change of seat, couchette,.. in the booked offer
- Option to extend the booking time limit (OnHold)
- Option to release tickets as an intermediate step for a refund
- Option to cancel a fulfillment
- Reimbursement of unused tickets
- Booking Search

This is an important release as it is the basis of implementations in the
Swedish as well as the Swiss market. Furthermore, part of the documentation will
be adopted by the TAP-TSI regulation.

See the [Release Notes 2.0](https://osdm.io//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v2.0/)

More to come!
