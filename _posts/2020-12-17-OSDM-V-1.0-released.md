The OSDM Steering group just released the Version 1.0 of the [OSDM Specification](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/spec/)
under the [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) Open Source Licence.

The aims of the [Open Sales and Distribution Model (OSDM)](imagehttps://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM) are twofold:

1. to substantially **simplify the booking process for customers** of rail trips and,
2. to **lower complexity and distribution costs** for distributors and railway carriers.

OSDM **strengthens rail** as a convenient and ecological means of transportation by simplifying distribution. Finally, it lays a **solid fundament** which can be extended to the distribution of other means of transportation.

Additionally to the the core work the following improvements have been added
and are part of this release:

- I-0: Reduce the complexity of the online model
- I-11: Add support for round trips
- I-12: Add support for Universal Rail Ticket
- I-14: Let the customer choose offers per segments independently
- I-15: Add support for stock control numbers

Thanks to all the [Team](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/team/) for its hard work.

Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!
