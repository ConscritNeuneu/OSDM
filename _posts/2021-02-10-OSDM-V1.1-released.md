The OSDM Steering group just released the Version 1.1 of the [OSDM Specification](https://osdm.io/spec/)
under the [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) Open Source License.

The aims of the [Open Sales and Distribution Model (OSDM)](https://osdm.io/OSDM) are twofold:

1. to substantially **simplify the booking process for customers** of rail trips and,
2. to **lower complexity and distribution costs** for distributors and railway carriers.

OSDM **strengthens rail** as a convenient and ecological means of transportation by simplifying distribution. Finally, it lays a **solid fundament** which can be extended to the distribution of other means of transportation.

In scope of this increment were various improvements proposed by railways as well as distributors:

- I-1 Enable combination rules between offers (Amadeus/Sqills/SBB)
- I-2 Support for stateless offers/booking processes (Sqills/DB)
- I-5 Add support for a fee (DB)
- I-9 Add binary in fulfillment messages (DB)
- I-23 Handle reduction cards that include other cards (Offline-Only)
- I-24 Add rules for minimum number of passengers (Offline Only)
- I-25 Short station name for route descriptions needed (Offline-Only) (DB, UIC)
- I-31-Remove-SEPERATE_TICKET-as-cluster-type (Offline-Only) (DB)

Thanks to all the [Team](https://osdm.io/team/) for its hard work.
