We're proud to release **Version 1.4** of the [OSDM Specification](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/spec/)
as well as access to the [OSDM Sandbox](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/sandbox/) and
the [OSDM Demo App](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/demo-app/) to all interested parties.

In scope of this increment were various improvements proposed by railways as well as distributors:

Epics PI-4

- [I-39 Add support for paperless complaint management (ERA)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-39-Add-support-for-paperless-complaint-management)
- [I-35 Travel validity depending on boarding time only (EURAIL)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-35-travel-validity-depending-on-boarding-time-only)
- [I-41 Option to indicate CarrierConstraints (Offline only) (SBB, DB)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-41-Option-to-indicate-CarrierConstraints)
- [I-42 Reduction cards should be made available to ticket vendors (Amadeus)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-42-Reduction-cards-should-be-made-available-to-ticket-vendors)
- [I-43 free included passengers should defined for a passenger constraint, not only a traveller type (Offline only) (DB, SNCB)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-43-free-included-passengers-should-be-linked-to-a-generic-passenger-constraint)
- [I-44 synchronization of bookings between carriers and distributors (ETT/Amadeus)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-44-booking-synchronization-management)
- [I-45 Add the responsible TCOs in the booking data provided by a fare provider (SNCB)](https://github.com/UnionInternationalCheminsdeFer/OSDM/wiki/I-45-Add-the-responsible-TCOs-in-the-booking-data)

Additionally we technically improved the API by adding the following tools:

- Add resource to properly search for bookings (including pagination)
- Establish Certification Process (PATRIC group)
- Engineer requirements for the automatization of the certifcation process
- Documentation update
- Security review using [42Crunch](https://42crunch.com/api-security-audit/)

See the [Release Notes 1.4](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM//releases/OSDM-release-notes-v1.4/) for more details.

Additionally, we have started to turn the specification into running code:

- **OSDM Sandbox:** The sandbox is kindly provided by Sqills
  and is open to any party interested in implementing OSDM.
  See [OSDM Sandbox](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/sandbox/) for details.

- **OSDM Demo App** Directly connecting to the sandbox is the demo app which covers the complete journey
  planning and booking flow. The app is open to any party interested in implementing OSDM.
  See [OSDM Demo App](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/demo-app/) for details.

- **Hermes/Hosa to OSDM (H2O) converter**: The aim of this online converter build by Hitrail is to build
  a migration path from the Hermes/Hosa protocol to OSDM. Thus if a railway does not support OSDM yet the
  Hermes/Hosa to OSDM (H2O) Converter ensures that it can connect to railways supporting OSDM. Conversely,
  if a railway only supports OSDM it guarantees that it can connect to railways supporting Hermes/Hosa only.
  See [OSDM H2O Converter](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/tools/H2O-converter/) for details.

More to come!

Thanks to all the [Team](https://unioninternationalcheminsdefer.github.io/OSDM/team/) for its hard work.
