## Background

The Open Sales and Distribution Model has emerged from the **nTM (new Tariff Model)** and **FSM (Full Service Model)** initiatives:

- The initiative new Tariff Model (nTM) initiated by UIC established the successor standard of
  **PRIFIS**. It defines on the one hand an offline standard for the exchange of priced segments
  (formerly: **PRIFIS series**) and on the other hand a new online standard for the purchase of
  dynamically priced segments. The priced segments are calculated and provided by so-called fare
  providers. The priced segments are fetched by an allocator which combines these priced segments into
  a consistent offer and later into a booking and ticket. Essentially, this process allows the vision
  of *"one trip - one ticket within Europe"* to be realized.

- The [Full Service Model (FSM 2.0)](https://tsga.eu/fsm) initiative defines an open standard for the
  distribution of rail services (bookings, reservations, integrated reservations and additional
  services) within Europe and beyond. By standardizing the distribution interface, the distribution of
  products and services can be greatly simplified.

To join forces and represent the **rail sector as a whole** the two initiatives have been merged into this initiative. The specification will be supported by the [UIC](https://uic.org) as **IRS 90918-10**.
