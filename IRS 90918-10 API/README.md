# Open Sales and Distribution Model (OSDM)

The Open Sales and Distribution Model has emerged from the **nTM (new Tariff Model)** and **FSM (Full Service Model)** initiatives and will be adopted by the UIC as Leaflet 90918-10.

The OSDM essentially consists of two parts: **Offline API** and **Online API**. The Online API works in two modes: **Distributor Mode** and Allocator Mode. The Allocator Mode differs from the Distributor Mode only in that additionally to *admissions*, *reservations*, *integrated reservations*, or *ancillaries* also *priced segments* are offered and can be booked.


## nTM

The initiative **new Tariff Model (nTM)** defines the successor standard of *PRIFIS*. It defines on the one hand an *offline standard* for the exchange of priced segments (formerly: PRIFIS series) and on the other hand a new *online standard* for the purchase of dynamically priced segments, which also shows savings offers can.

The priced segments are calculated and provided by so-called **fare providers**. The priced segments are fetched by an **allocator** which combines these priced segments into a consistent offer and later into a booking and ticket. In essence, the standard allows the vision of "one trip - one ticket in Europe" to be realized.

## FSM

The **Full Service Model (FSM 2.0)** initiative defines an open standard for the distribution of rail services (bookings, reservations, integrated reservations and additional services) within Europe. By standardizing the distribution interface, a complex and expansive connection links per country is no longer needed, greatly simplifying the distribution of tickets.
