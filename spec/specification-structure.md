The [OSDM specification](./) is structured into two parts sharing common
data structures:

## Common Data Structures

## Part I: Offline Model

The [Offline Model](./offline-model/) defines how the offline data can be exchanged.

## Part II: Online API

The [Online API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/schlpbch/uic-90918_10_osdm/1.1.0-rc)
is explained in this documents:

- [Technical Principles](./technical-principles/)
- [Processes](./processes/)
- [Models](./models/)

## Catalog of Code Lists

A [Catalog of Code Lists](./catalog-of-code-lists/) defines attributes
and provides references to standards used.

## Business Requirements

Business needs leading to this specification are captured in the [requirement](./requirements) and the [business capabilities](./business-capabilities) documents.

## Compliance to the Specification

In order for an implementation to be compliant, depending on its role, a set of service need to be
implemented as lined out in the [Compliance](./compliance/) section.
