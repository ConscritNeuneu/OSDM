## Aim

The aim of the **OSDM demo app** is to provide a working app to interesting parties to start
implementing their apps and clients.

The app covers the complete booking flow, including the reservation of seats and ancillary
services, and supports trains, buses or other means of public transport.

The demo app is kindly provided by [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch) and is open to *any party*
interested in implementing OSDM.

## Contact

The app will be open sourced as soon as SBB has the clearance from its legal department (scheduled for December for 2021). Until
then please contact [Andreas Schlapbach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-schlapbach/).
